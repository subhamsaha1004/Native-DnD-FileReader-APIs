Native-DnD-FileReader-APIs
==========================

An introduction and initial experimentation with the Native Drag and Drop and Filereader APIs. Nothing particularly useful, just seeing how things work. Contains dragging, dropping, sorting. Also has dragging from desktop feature implemented, which shows progress bar and file info on drop.
